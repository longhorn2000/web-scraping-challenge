Before You Begin


Create a new repository for this project called web-scraping-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the web scraping challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: Missions_to_Mars.


Add your notebook files to this folder as well as your flask app.


Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.



Step 1 - Scraping
Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

Create a Jupyter Notebook file called mission_to_mars.ipynb and use this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.


NASA Mars News

Scrape the NASA Mars News Site and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.

JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image


Visit the url for JPL Featured Space Image here.


Use splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called featured_image_url.


Make sure to find the image url to the full size .jpg image.


Make sure to save a complete url string for this image.
